	<h3>Terms and Conditions of the Summer 2014 Pre-College Program Residence License Agreement</h3>
	<p><em>**Keep this document for your records and reference**</em></p>
	<p>This document defines the terms and conditions of the Residence License Agreement (Agreement) for a licensee (resident) in the University residential system.</p>
	<p>The Summer 2014 housing rates listed on the Residence License Agreement are for residence and dining, on a Residence License Agreement basis, for the term of the summer pre-college program noted. All residence and dining plan rates are assessed on a per person basis. Rates for programs that are not listed will be determined by BU Housing.</p>
	<p>A dining plan is mandatory for all residents assigned to dormitory-style residences.</p>
	<p>Licensees and guarantors must settle their student account, in full, by the first day of the summer pre-college program. The assigned residence accommodation and dining plan are exclusively for the use of the licensee. The University reserves the right to increase its residence and dining plan rates, including the right to assess increases in energy costs. If assessed, increases shall be applied in the form of a pro rata adjustment. Boston University shall not be responsible for any delay or nondelivery of utilities or other services to residence facilities that are beyond the University's control.</p>
	<p>Boston University, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to assign and reassign students in the residential system or to revoke and terminate any Agreement at any time for any reason set forth or referred to in this document. In the event that any such reassignment occurs to a residence accommodation with a residence rate higher or lower than the rate for the accommodation initially assigned, a supplemental charge or credit will be made for the pro rata portion of the difference.</p>
	<hr />
	<div class="righthalf">
		<h4 class="term">ELIGIBILITY</h4>
	<p class="term">The University's residence facilities are primarily intended for occupancy by its registered students, matriculating Boston University students, or students in an officially recognized Boston University special summer program. Students shall be eligible for residence privileges if they are registered students as determined by the University Registrar and have settled their accounts as determined by Student Accounting Services. Both registration and settlement of accounts must be completed in accordance with established policies and procedures. Students shall be ineligible for residence privileges if they are withdrawn officially or unofficially, suspended, or expelled from the University.</p>
	<p class="term">To be eligible for on-campus housing for summer pre-college programs, students must be at least 14 years old by the first day of class of the summer pre-college program enrolled.</p>
	<h4 class="term">DINING PROGRAM/BOSTON UNIVERSITY TERRIER CARDS</h4>
	<p class="term">Each resident will be issued a Boston University Terrier Card (Terrier Card). Each resident with a dining plan must present this Terrier Card at the dining location in order to be served. The Terrier Card is also used for residence access on campus. The Terrier Card must be carried at all times and may not be used by anyone other than the resident named on the card; it remains the property of the University and must be surrendered to the University upon demand. Alteration or use of the card for any unauthorized purpose will result in confiscation, financial penalty, and/or disciplinary action.</p>
	<p class="term">If the Terrier Card is lost, damaged, or stolen, the student should report this in person, by telephone, or in writing to Boston University, Terrier Card Office, 775 Commonwealth Avenue, lower level, Boston, MA 02215, 617-353-9966, Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m.; or in person at the summer residence dining room office Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, noon-5 p.m. If the student reports loss or theft of the card within two (2) business days, the student will be liable for $50, or for the amount of the unauthorized use before the student notifies the Terrier Card Office (or the summer residence dining room office on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays), whichever is less. If the student fails to notify the Terrier Card Office (or the summer residence dining room office on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays) within two (2) business days of the loss or theft of the card, his/her maximum liability increases to $500 or the amount of the unauthorized use, whichever is less. A lost, damaged, or stolen Terrier Card can be replaced at the Terrier Card Office for a fee of $40. Multiple replacements may result in additional fees up to $50 in each instance.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="lefthalf">
		<p class="term">Licensees assigned to dormitory-style residences who do not select a dining plan will be assigned automatically to the choice dining plan of the summer pre-college program. If the summer pre-college program offers a choice of dining plans, students enrolled in the program may request to change their dining plan through the first week of the program. To change dining plans, students must bring their Terrier Card to the Terrier Card Office and complete a dining plan change form. Changes will become effective on the first Monday following the submission of the change request. The summer dining week begins on Monday. There may be costs associated with dining plan changes.</p>

Every resident is encouraged to obtain/carry adequate personal property insurance and health insurance. Subject to the provisions of applicable law, the University shall not be liable directly or indirectly for personal injury, loss, and/or damage to personal property of a resident, guarantor, legal guardian or guest caused by fire, theft, or any other cause, whether such personal injury, loss, or damage occurs in a residence facility or elsewhere on or off the University campus. The resident and guarantor expressly authorize the University to receive and sign for all personal property and goods delivered to the student's residence accommodation or facility.</p>
		<p class="term">As licensees, residents shall indemnify and hold the University harmless from all loss, damage, or liability to any person arising from any nuisance made or suffered in or around the residence accommodation or facility by the resident or guest, or from any carelessness, negligence, or improper conduct of such resident or guest.</p>
		<h4 class="term">RESIDENCE AND FACILITY CONDITION/CARE OF PREMISES</h4>
		<p class="term">Each resident is responsible for the care of University property in the residence accommodation and, as determined by the University, in the common areas of the residence facility. No resident may paint, put nails or screws in, make holes in, or otherwise alter or damage the residence accommodation or any other part of the residence facility, without on each occasion obtaining prior written consent from the appropriate University administrator. The cost of any repair or cleaning or damage or loss to the residence facility will result in appropriate charges to the resident(s) responsible for violating this policy. Residents are prohibited from removing any furnishings from their accommodations.</p>
		<p class="term">Each resident is required to verify and sign a Room Condition Report form upon checking in to the residence accommodation. In instances when the resident fails to sign this form, BU Housing will assume an initial level of "good condition" for the furnishings and equipment. Each resident may be responsible for a prorated assessment in the event of damage or loss to the accommodation or to common areas of the residence facility if the damage or loss is reasonably determined by the University to have been caused by carelessness, negligence, or improper conduct by the residents or their guests but cannot be attributed to specific individuals.</p>
		<p class="term">Each resident shall be responsible for keeping the residence accommodation, including all the furnishings and equipment, clean and safe, and for maintaining the cleanliness and order of public areas and lavatories. Residents are prohibited from placing any garbage or trash or other receptacles, vehicles, bicycles, or other articles in the halls or other common areas or passageways of the residence facility. The University reserves the right, at the expense of the licensee and/or guarantor, to remove personal property stored or placed in common areas in violation of this Agreement. Such property shall be deemed to have been abandoned and shall not be returned to a claimant without satisfactory proof of ownership and payment of all expenses of removal and storage.</p>
		<p class="term">Residents may not remove windows or screens or throw objects from windows, fire escapes, doors, or other exterior parts of the residence facility. Residents may post or hang signs, posters, banners, and the like on the walls of, or in or about, the residence facility only as permitted by University policy.</p></div>
