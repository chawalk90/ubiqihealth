<h2>Workshop Selection</h2>
<p>You'll take three six-day workshops. Please number in order of prederence, and return as soon as possible to the AMP office. 1 = first choice, 5 = last choice. For more detailed information on workshop content, consult course descriptions in the AMP handbook. We'll make every effort to honor each student's top three requests, but reserve the right to assign the order and final selections. Please remember to include your name.</p>
