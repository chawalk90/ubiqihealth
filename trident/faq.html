	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<p>DO YOU TAKE RESERVATIONS?</p>

<p>Yes. We take reservations Monday through Thursday. We do not take reservations for brunch or Mondays that are holidays. Reserve a table by calling the store at (617) 267-8688 or by going to our homepage.</p>

<p>DO YOU DELIVER?</p>

<p>No, but Dashed and Dining In deliver for us. Order online at foodler.com or diningin.com.</p>

<p>I SELF-PUBLISHED A BOOK/MAGAZINE. WILL YOU SELL IT? DO YOU TAKE BOOKS ON CONSIGNMENT?</p>

<p>Good questions. We do have a consignment program, but we can’t take every book that comes through the door. Our consignment agreement provisions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The consignor will receive 60% of the cover price of each item sold.</li>
<li>Unsold consignment items must be picked up within 90 days.</li>
<li>Trident is not responsible for lost or stolen items.</li>
<li>A check for items sold will be issued and mailed upon pickup of remaining items by consignor.</li>
<li>If all items are sold, a check will be issued and mailed within 60 days of the date of the last item sold.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can apply to our consignment program by filling out this form with a description and excerpt of the book, as well as how you plan to drive people to our store to buy your book.</p>

<p>YOU HAVE A REALLY NICE SPACE UPSTAIRS. CAN I HOST MY PRIVATE EVENT THERE?</p>

<p>Yes! We have hosted all sorts of private functions, from sorority mixers to wedding rehearsal dinners to graduation parties. For pricing and more information, visit our webpage here or email catering@tridentbookscafe.com.</p>

<p>DO YOU HOLD BOOK READINGS OR OTHER AUTHOR EVENTS?</p>

<p>Heck yeah we do! You can see our full events calendar here. Almost all of our author events are free and open to the public. Our diverse space upstairs has been host to a variety of events–reading, beer tastings, cooking demos, even speed dating.</p>

<p>Are you an author? Ask us about holding an event by emailing events@tridentbookscafe.com.</p>

<p>DO YOU SELL USED BOOKS?</p>

<p>We have a very, very small selection of used books, but we have a huge selection of remainders, which are leftover books from recent print runs that are sold at a reduced price. Like, really reduced. Like, you can get a previously $25 hardcover for nine bucks.</p>

<p>DO YOU BUY USED BOOKS?</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>CAN I ORDER BOOKS FROM YOU ONLINE? CAN I LOOK AT YOUR INVENTORY ONLINE?</p>

<p>We do not have a way for you to order books or to view our inventory online; however, please feel free to call the store to ask if we have a book in stock. If we don’t have a book, we can special order it and have it in the store as soon as the next day.</p>

<p>YOU DON’T HAVE A CERTAIN TITLE IN STOCK. CAN I STILL GET IT FROM YOU?</p>

<p>Yes! We take special orders for just about everything. Depending on the title, we can have it in the story by the next day. That means that we can get the book to you faster than online outlets, with no shipping costs, and most of the time without prepayment. To special order a book, call the store at (617) 267-8688.</p>
