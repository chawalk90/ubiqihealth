	<h3>Terms and Conditions of the Summer 2014 Pre-College Program Residence License Agreement</h3>
	<p>**Keep this document for your records and reference**</p>
	<p>This document defines the terms and conditions of the Residence License Agreement (Agreement) for a licensee (resident) in the University residential system.</p>
	<p>The Summer 2014 housing rates listed on the Residence License Agreement are for residence and dining, on a Residence License Agreement basis, for the term of the summer pre-college program noted. All residence and dining plan rates are assessed on a per person basis. Rates for programs that are not listed will be determined by BU Housing.</p>
	<p>A dining plan is mandatory for all residents assigned to dormitory-style residences.</p>
	<p>Licensees and guarantors must settle their student account, in full, by the first day of the summer pre-college program. The assigned residence accommodation and dining plan are exclusively for the use of the licensee. The University reserves the right to increase its residence and dining plan rates, including the right to assess increases in energy costs. If assessed, increases shall be applied in the form of a pro rata adjustment. Boston University shall not be responsible for any delay or nondelivery of utilities or other services to residence facilities that are beyond the University's control.</p>
	<p>Boston University, at its sole discretion, reserves the right to assign and reassign students in the residential system or to revoke and terminate any Agreement at any time for any reason set forth or referred to in this document. In the event that any such reassignment occurs to a residence accommodation with a residence rate higher or lower than the rate for the accommodation initially assigned, a supplemental charge or credit will be made for the pro rata portion of the difference.</p>
	<hr />
	<div class="righthalf">
		<h4 class="term">ELIGIBILITY</h4>
	<p class="term">The University's residence facilities are primarily intended for occupancy by its registered students, matriculating Boston University students, or students in an officially recognized Boston University special summer program. Students shall be eligible for residence privileges if they are registered students as determined by the University Registrar and have settled their accounts as determined by Student Accounting Services. Both registration and settlement of accounts must be completed in accordance with established policies and procedures. Students shall be ineligible for residence privileges if they are withdrawn officially or unofficially, suspended, or expelled from the University.</p>
	<p class="term">To be eligible for on-campus housing for summer pre-college programs, students must be at least 14 years old by the first day of class of the summer pre-college program enrolled.</p>
	<h4 class="term">DINING PROGRAM/BOSTON UNIVERSITY TERRIER CARDS</h4>
	<p class="term">Each resident will be issued a Boston University Terrier Card (Terrier Card). Each resident with a dining plan must present this Terrier Card at the dining location in order to be served. The Terrier Card is also used for residence access on campus. The Terrier Card must be carried at all times and may not be used by anyone other than the resident named on the card; it remains the property of the University and must be surrendered to the University upon demand. Alteration or use of the card for any unauthorized purpose will result in confiscation, financial penalty, and/or disciplinary action.</p>
	<p class="term">If the Terrier Card is lost, damaged, or stolen, the student should report this in person, by telephone, or in writing to Boston University, Terrier Card Office, 775 Commonwealth Avenue, lower level, Boston, MA 02215, 617-353-9966, Monday-Friday, 9 a.m.-5 p.m.; or in person at the summer residence dining room office Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, noon-5 p.m. If the student reports loss or theft of the card within two (2) business days, the student will be liable for $50, or for the amount of the unauthorized use before the student notifies the Terrier Card Office (or the summer residence dining room office on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays), whichever is less. If the student fails to notify the Terrier Card Office (or the summer residence dining room office on Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays) within two (2) business days of the loss or theft of the card, his/her maximum liability increases to $500 or the amount of the unauthorized use, whichever is less. A lost, damaged, or stolen Terrier Card can be replaced at the Terrier Card Office for a fee of $40. Multiple replacements may result in additional fees up to $50 in each instance.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="lefthalf">
		<p class="term">Licensees assigned to dormitory-style residences who do not select a dining plan will be assigned automatically to the choice dining plan of the summer pre-college program. If the summer pre-college program offers a choice of dining plans, students enrolled in the program may request to change their dining plan through the first week of the program. To change dining plans, students must bring their Terrier Card to the Terrier Card Office and complete a dining plan change form. Changes will become effective on the first Monday following the submission of the change request. The summer dining week begins on Monday. There may be costs associated with dining plan changes.</p>
